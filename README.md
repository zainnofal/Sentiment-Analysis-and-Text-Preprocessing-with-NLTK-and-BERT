# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Text-Preprocessing-with-NLTK-and-BERT
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.
The dataset, tweet_emotions.csv, includes tweet text and associated sentiment labels. The key components include:

Text Preprocessing: Utilizing NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and cleaning of text data.

Data Visualization: Generating word clouds and bar plots to visualize the most common words in the dataset.

Logistic Regression Model: Building and training a logistic regression model using TF-IDF vectorization to classify tweet sentiments.

BERT-based Model: Implementing a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for sequence classification, providing an advanced approach to sentiment prediction.

Model Persistence: Saving the trained models for future use with joblib.

The project showcases various techniques for preparing, visualizing, and analyzing textual data, as well as implementing traditional and transformer-based models for sentiment classification.
